# k-07 3d print venturis for glow model engines

3d printing heat and chemical resistant venturi tubes is now possible.

Suggested material: Currently I'm printing them from PETG and they seem to work fine. However I don't have long time or summer heat experience yet.
Nylon would be a more resistant material to use.

Print settings: I use slighty higher than necesary temperature for better adhesion. Also, using adhesion skirt (which touches the part) really help with the initial adhesion.

I will most probably continue adding designs for more motors.

File name pattern: venturis-{diameter}x{base length}-[all|{inner diameter}]-{engine}.[blend|stl|gcode]
Eg.
venturis-8.5x7.9-all-GP15.blend - contains venturi with 8.5 mm shaft diameter, 7.9 mm shaft length, all internal diameters, for GP15 engines.

Supported engines - recommended size:

 - GP15 - 3mm
 - LA15 - ???
